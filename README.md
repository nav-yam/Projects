# Projects
GOG: Guardians of Galaxy was my very first project that I entirely created in my first semester of college. I created it using the PyGame library and poured all of my knowledge of classes, loops, and other programming constructs into it.
The game's rules are straightforward: hover your mouse pointer over the objects and press the spacebar or enter/return key to destroy them. If none of them are eliminated in 12 seconds or the enemy count exceeds a dozen, the game comes to an end. Each kill gives you a score, while each missed shot reduces your score by one. Destroying the suddenly appearing UFO grants you a SuperPower for 3 seconds.
